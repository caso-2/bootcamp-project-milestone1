            The NBA fined Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga $35,000 for the actions that led to his ejection late in the first half of a preseason win in Portland on Tuesday night.
            Kuminga was upset after he didn't receive a whistle on a shot attempt with seven seconds left in the second quarter. Kuminga stumbled while attempting a barreling transition drive through two defenders, missed the layup and immediately went after nearby official Rodney Mott, clapping in Mott's face. Mott ejected Kuminga.
